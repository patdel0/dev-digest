# Django server

The Django server is hosted on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/patdel0/dev-digest-backend/tree/main).

To execute a fetch request, add the `/api` endpoint you intend to access at the end of the URL as shown in the example below.

```js
fetch('https://patdel0-dev-digest-backend.hf.space/api/hello')
```
