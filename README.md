### Quick Start Scripts

**Setup**: Initialise your environment with:

```sh
./script/setup
```

This installs dependencies.

**Run Server**: Start the Django server with:

```sh
./script/server
```

Access your app at `http://localhost:8000/`.

Make scripts executable if needed:

```sh
chmod +x ./script/*
```
